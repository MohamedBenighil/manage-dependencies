```bash
- create new project
- add clerk with local  "/signin" and "/signout" routes (instead of external routes like the default): use 2 env var
    - Go hyperui : look for "auth form". Then redirect to the / after "/signin": use 2 env var. PS: it works without those env vars


- create navbar: it changes when the user is connected. PS use rafce snippet

```
